A learning styles based Recommender System Prototype for edX courses

Here I've created a prototype that recommends edX courses as per a student learning styles.
I did this work for my dissertation. If you have read my research paper and have come here, I would recommend you to build the project and run the "Driver" class. If you haven't, possibilities are that you wont as it is supposed to take time to come in print, and at this present time, I'm writing it. But I'm keeping this here, since I have to mention this in my paper.
	It can be a bit vague and it is poorly managed at the time. But I'll get back to update this later
